I'm a first-year student in the <a href=https://capp.cs.uchicago.edu>MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy</a> (MSCAPP) program at the University of Chicago. I am transitioning into software engineering and data science after several years of experience in Washington, D.C., including as a paralegal, in issue-advocacy public relations, in digital campaign fundraising, and as an on-staff researcher, both for an elected official and for a small policy think tank. I'm also a game show champion.

Excited to learn about career opportunities with a technical focus in the civic and social good sectors.

Projects I've worked on include:
<ul>
  <li><a href=https://github.com/uchicago-capp122-winter23/30122-project-redistricting-redux>Redistricting Redux</a>: a quarter-long project with a focus on software design, data ingestion via API, and data visualization. Written in Python (including geopandas and scikit-learn).</li>
</ul>
