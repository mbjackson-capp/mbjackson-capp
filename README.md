I'm a second-year student in the <a href=https://capp.cs.uchicago.edu>MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy</a> (MSCAPP) program at the University of Chicago (expected graduation: June 2024). I am transitioning into data-focused software engineering roles after several years of policy experience in Washington, D.C., including as a paralegal, in issue-advocacy public relations, in digital campaign fundraising, and as an on-staff researcher, both for an elected official and for a small policy think tank. I'm also a <a href="https://j-archive.com/showplayer.php?player_id=10171&highlight=matt+jackson">game show champion</a>.

I recently completed an internship with the Data department at the <a href=https://www.cookcountyassessor.com>Cook County Assessor's Office</a>. I am excited to learn more about full-time career opportunities with a technical focus in the public, civic, and social good sectors.

Projects I've worked on include:
<ul>
  <li><a href=https://github.com/uchicago-capp122-winter23/30122-project-redistricting-redux>Redistricting Redux</a>: quarter-long project with a focus on software design, data ingestion via API, and data visualization. Written in Python (including geopandas and scikit-learn).</li>
  <li><a href=https://github.com/necabotheking/ml-affordable-care-act>Understanding Public Perceptions of the Affordable Care Act ("Obamacare")</a>: quarter-long machine learning project with a focus on natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, hyperparameter tuning, model design, evaluation metrics, and generalization.</li>
</ul>
