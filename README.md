I am a Data Engineer within <a href=https://www.phila.gov/departments/office-of-innovation-and-technology/citygeo/>CityGeo</a>, a division of the City of Philadelphia's Office of Innovation and Technology. Before that, I held a graduate student internship with the Data department at the <a href=https://www.cookcountyassessor.com>Cook County Assessor's Office</a>. 

I'm a recent graduate of the masters program in <a href=https://capp.cs.uchicago.edu>MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy</a> (CAPP) at the University of Chicago. 

Projects I've worked on include:
<ul>
  <li><a href=https://github.com/mbjackson-capp/questions_to_cards>questions_to_cards</a>: Personal project; pandas-based pipeline for taking an archived database of quizbowl questions and converting it into category-tagged, single-clue digital flashcards.
  <li><a href=https://github.com/uchicago-capp-30320/RouteRangers>Plan-My-Transit ("Route Rangers")</a>: Capstone project for "Software Engineering for Civic Tech"; takes in user information about frequent commutes, and shows the most in-demand gaps in existing public transit coverage to transit planners. Written in Django, with Postgres (PostGIS) backend; front-end visualizations powered by Leaflet.</li> 
  <li><a href=https://github.com/FedericoDM/NLP-Police-Complaints>Analyzing Complaints Against A City Police Department with Natural Language Processing (NLP)</a>: Capstone project for "Advanced Machine Learning for Public Policy"; obtained a corpus of 2,148 PDF reports from a city's Civilian Office of Police Accountability, then performed topic modeling, named entity recognition (NER), and summarization tasks with state-of-the-art NLP models.</li>
  <li><a href=https://github.com/uchicago-capp122-winter23/30122-project-redistricting-redux>Redistricting Redux</a>: quarter-long project with a focus on software design, data ingestion via API, and data visualization. Written in Python (including geopandas and scikit-learn).</li>
</ul>

I enjoy coding challenges; I'm currently working through <a href=https://github.com/mbjackson-capp/adventofcode>Advent of Code</a> and <a href=https://github.com/mbjackson-capp/everybodycodes>Everybody Codes</a>.

I'm also a <a href="https://j-archive.com/showplayer.php?player_id=10171&highlight=matt+jackson">game show champion</a>.
